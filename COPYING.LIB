                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically library packages--
 of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use
 it.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
 about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License
 is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
 explanations below.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 and not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
 that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
 charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or
 can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
 pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
 things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
 have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
 software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
 freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, have
 access to the source code.  And you must show them these terms so
 they know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU Lesser General Public License protect your
 rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2)
 offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,
 distribute and/or modify the software.

 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
 we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
 original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
 on the original authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
 the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
 that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
 licensed at all.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
 of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation
 is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  "Source
 code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all
 the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
 compilation and installation of the library.

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
 from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
 work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in
 a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the
 Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
 a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
   to all third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
   table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
   the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
   is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
   in the event an application does not supply such function or data,
   the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
   purpose remains meaningful.

 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who
 wrote it.

 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.

 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
 Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a
 volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
 work under the scope of this License.

 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To
 do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,
 so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, and
 then follow the ordinary General Public License in all respects.
 (If a newer version of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
 appeared which is incompatible with version 2 of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, then you may follow the terms of that newer
 ordinary General Public License instead.)

 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
 which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies this obligation.

 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
 or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
 it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses
 the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be
 considered a derivative work of the Library if the header file
 contains significant designations of interfaces or other material
 beyond simple function declarations and macros.  Therefore, if the
 library provides header files that contain object code fragments or
 template implementations, you should consider whether integrating
 those fragments into your work might cause your work to become a
 derivative work of the Library and thus be covered by this License.

 6. As an exception to the sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.

 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the combined
 work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
 use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this
 License.  If the combined work is linked statically, or otherwise
 contains a copy of the Library object code, you must do one of the
 following things:

   a) Accompany the combined work with the complete corresponding
   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
   changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
   Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the combined work is an
   executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine
   readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
   source code, so that the recipient can modify the Library and
   relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
   Library.  (It is understood that the recipient may require the
   use of a suitable linker program to combine the modified object
   code with the modified Library.)

   b) Accompany the combined work with a written offer, valid for at
   least three years, to give the same recipient the materials
   specified in subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the
   cost of performing this distribution.

   c) Accompany the combined work with the information you received
   as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This
   alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
   only if you received the combined work in object code or
   executable form with such an offer, in accord with subsection
   6b.)

 The reason for this exception is that linking a library into an
 executable is ordinarily the same as copying the library into the
 executable.  The ordinary General Public License therefore treats
 the executable as a derivative work of the library.  Linking an
 executable with a library is just making a combined work that is
 normally subject to the ordinary General Public License.

 When a facility in a library refers to a function or a table of data
 to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, the
 publisher of the executable may ensure the requirements of this
 License are met by the use of alternative means, such as providing
 the recipient with a suitable ``stub'' or ``wrapper'' that, when
 linked with the recipient's application, will produce a functionally
 equivalent executable.

 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
 library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such
 a combined library, provided that the distribution is accompanied
 by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the
 Library facilities of the combined library.  The source code for
 the other library facilities need not be distributed.

 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
 your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received
 copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
 licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
 Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
 any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
 granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
 third parties to this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
 not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
 this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
 consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example,
 if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
 the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
 through you, then the only way you could distribute the Library
 would be to obtain a different license which does not impose such
 a restriction.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
 the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
 License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
 excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
 or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License
 incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
 License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  Each
 version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
 status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
 sharing and reuse of software generally.

 NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
 PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY PART OF THE
 LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU (NOT THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER
 PARTIES WHO DISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF THE LIBRARY IS AUTHORIZED
 HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistributors to copy and distribute the library under this License.

 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It
 is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
 have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
 notice is found.

   <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

   This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
   modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
   version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
   Lesser General Public License for more details.

   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
   Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
